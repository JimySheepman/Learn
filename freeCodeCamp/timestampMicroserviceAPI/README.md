Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

    Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
    Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
    Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

Note: Time zones conversion is not a purpose of this project, so assume all sent valid dates will be parsed with new Date() as GMT dates.
