// Creator
//
// The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects.
// Itâ€™s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.
// You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement
// their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method
// can return some default product type. Note, despite its name, product creation is not
// the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some
// core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic
// from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development
// company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function
// of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.
